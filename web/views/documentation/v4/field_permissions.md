## `Field Permissions`

By default, all authenticated users have access to all available fields in the API responses. However, in some cases, certain fields may not be returned due to data permissions or access restrictions.

If you notice that expected fields are missing from your API responses, or if you require access to additional data fields, please contact our support team.

When contacting support, please include:

- Your API token
- The specific endpoint you're calling
- The fields you expected to receive but are missing
- A sample of your API request and response
